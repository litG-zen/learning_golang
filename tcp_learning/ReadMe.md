This is an attempt in learning creating my own http server right from TCP streaming.
We will do that in steps. 
 - Read a fixed size data from a file and print it to console. 
 - Read a whole line fron a file and print it to console.
 - Read the file line by line using Go Channels(to mimick a streaming client) and print to console.
 - Go channel + TCP listener
